# ClimbJios

Hello folks! Welcome to the ClimbJios repo. To start contributing, read through this guide.

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/climbjios-sg/climbjios-app/issues) to handle everything from design to code.

## Release

We following [semenatic versioning](https://semver.org).

See our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/climbjios-sg/climbjios-app/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

To make a new release, you have to bump the version in [frontend/package.json](https://github.com/climbjios-sg/climbjios-app/blob/main/frontend/package.json) and update the CHANGELOG.

We count each merge to main as a new release.
