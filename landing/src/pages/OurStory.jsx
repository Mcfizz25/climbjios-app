                      I started climbing back in 2021. I was hooked right after
                      my first session.

                    The adrenaline rush, the sense of accomplishment when you
                    finally grabbed the last hold with both hands, the
                    incredible community and countless fist bumps. There's no
                    other sport that brings me more joy than climbing.

                    It's the community that brings me back. We climb together,
                    solve problems together, regardless of our nationality, race
                    or gender. I remember the long conversations with friends
                    met in the climbing gym in Sweden. I remember the friendly
                    lead climbers giving us advice at the outdoor routes in
                    Krabi. I remember the Allez and fist bumps from strangers at
                    FitBloc and B+.
